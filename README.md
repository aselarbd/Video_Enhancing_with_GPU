# Video_Enhancing_with_GPU

In here I have used histogram equalization as the tecnique. 

Using this program you can enhance video quality by adjusting contast.

This program need OpenCV libries to run. It is better if c++ vertin run using Vishual studio

CUDA C is used to implement GPU vertion of this software.

As benchmark 1080p video processing time is 15X time faster in GPU than CPU.
